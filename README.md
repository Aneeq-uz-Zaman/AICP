# AICP Challenges

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to programming challenges from the AICP (Artificial Intelligence & Cloud Platform) curriculum. Each folder corresponds to a different task, and the code is organized for clarity and easy reference.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Computer Customization System
Implemented a robust system that enables users to customize their dream computers. Users can select core components like case, RAM, and hard disk, and even opt for additional items. The program calculates the total price, applies discounts for multiple purchases, and provides a comprehensive order summary. ðŸ’»âœ¨


### Task 2: Train Booking System
Developed a dynamic Python program for a train booking system. Passengers can purchase tickets at various times during the day, with the system tracking available seats, total revenue, and generating an end-of-day summary. The ticket sales continue until all seats are sold, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly experience. ðŸš‚ðŸ’¨
